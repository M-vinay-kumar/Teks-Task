## Training & Testing Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, Training & Testing.ipynb, designed to demonstrate the process of data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for a machine learning project.

## Overview
The notebook is structured into multiple sections, covering:

- **`Importing Libraries and Dataset:`** Loading the required libraries and data for analysis.

- **`Data Insights:`** Exploring the dataset to uncover patterns, missing values, and other characteristics.

- **`Feature Preparation:`** Creating feature (x) and target (y) variables for machine learning models.
